============================================================

51: I'll systematically analyze each answer choice by comparing it to the reference object.

## Reference Object Key Features:
- Purple block: front-left lower area
- Maroon/burgundy blocks: left-front tower area
- Tall teal/green block: back-center elevated
- Navy/dark blue block: centrally located
- Lime green visible: on left side
- Gray block: front-right area
- Detached block visible in top/bottom views
- Color palette: various greens (olive, teal, dark), purple, maroon, navy

## Analysis of Each Choice:

### **Choice 1 (Far Left):**
Looking at this orientation:
- I can see purple blocks prominently on the left side
- Yellow/tan colored blocks visible
- Maroon/burgundy blocks present
- Green blocks in various shades
- Dark gray/black blocks
- The arrangement shows blocks in a compact formation

Comparing to reference: The purple positioning looks reasonable, maroon blocks are present, but I need to verify the overall color distribution matches.

### **Choice 2 (Second from Left):**
This shows:
- Teal/cyan blocks prominent in the upper portion
- Dark green blocks
- Pink/magenta block visible
- Navy/dark blue blocks
- Lime green blocks visible at bottom
- Gray blocks present

Comparing to reference: The pink/magenta block is questionable - the reference has purple and maroon, but this appears more pink. The teal distribution seems different.

### **Choice 3 (Third from Left):**
This displays:
- Lime/bright green blocks prominent on top
- Purple/magenta block visible
- Yellow/tan block visible on left
- Gray blocks
- Dark green blocks
- Brown/olive blocks

Comparing to reference: The bright lime green on top and yellow blocks are visible. The purple block is present. This arrangement needs careful verification.

### **Choice 4 (Far Right):**
This shows:
- Purple/magenta blocks on upper right
- Yellow/tan block visible
- Lime green blocks prominent
- Dark purple/maroon blocks
- Gray blocks
- Green blocks in various shades

Comparing to reference: Purple is present, lime green visible, maroon tones present. The spatial arrangement looks promising.

## Detailed Verification:

**Choice 1:** Has purple, maroon, and appropriate greens. The yellow/tan blocks correspond to what might be olive green from a different angle. The configuration matches the reference's asymmetric stepped structure.

**Choice 2:** The pink/magenta tone is too bright compared to the reference's purple. The cyan/teal prominence doesn't match the reference distribution.

**Choice 3:** The bright lime green dominance on top doesn't match - the reference has the tall teal block at back-center, not bright lime on top prominently.

**Choice 4:** Purple positioning and lime green are present, but the overall spatial arrangement seems less consistent with the reference's structure.

## Final Verification of Choice 1:
- Purple block: visible on left side ✓
- Maroon blocks: present in the structure ✓
- Various green shades: olive, dark green visible ✓
- Gray/black blocks: present ✓
- Yellow/tan (olive from different lighting): matches ✓
- Asymmetric stepped structure: matches ✓

**Choice 2**: This appears to be a different rotation showing the structure from another angle. The colors and arrangements match the reference.

**Choice 3**: Very similar to choice 1, showing the structure from a slightly different rotational angle. The key features align with the reference.

**Choice 4**: Shows the structure from yet another angle. Let me verify the color relationships more carefully.

## Verification Process:

Comparing each choice with the reference views (Images 2-13):

- **Choice 1**: Matches the Front-Top-Left view (Image 11) very closely
- **Choice 2**: Could match a Front-Bottom-Right type rotation

Outputs 54-55 were not saved. They are marked wrong.

Spatial Reasoning Results - two-stage mode
Problems 56-100
================================================================================

56: I'll analyze this rotation puzzle systematically, focusing on views 6-11 and prioritizing shape arrangement over color.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reference Object Structure

From the orthogonal views (images 6-11):
- **Top View**: Shows a cross-like or H-shaped structure with two main clusters and a central gap
- **Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left views**: Show the 3D structure from various angles, revealing height variations and the purple tower as the tallest element
- **Front-Bottom-Right, Back-Bottom-Left views**: Show the underside perspectives

Key structural features:
1. Central void/gap running through the middle
2. Tall purple tower (3+ blocks high)
3. Two main mass clusters on either side of the gap
4. Irregular height distribution with several elevated blocks

## Step 2: Analyzing Each Answer Choice

### **Choice 1 (Top-left):**
Looking at the orientation and structure:
- Has a similar irregular arrangement
- Purple/blue tower visible in the back-left area
- Shows two-cluster structure with central spacing
- Block arrangement appears consistent with a rotation of the reference
- The purple tower position and overall mass distribution match

### **Choice 2 (Top-right):**
- Also shows irregular structure
- Has tall purple elements
- Two-cluster arrangement visible
- Different orientation from Choice 1
- The structure appears to have similar complexity

### **Choice 3 (Bottom-left):**
- Shows a more vertical/upright orientation
- Tall purple tower prominent
- Has central void/gap
- Multiple height levels visible
- Mass distribution looks consistent

### **Choice 4 (Bottom-right):**
- Different orientation angle
- Purple elements visible
- Gap/void structure present
- Shows the characteristic irregular arrangement

## Step 3: Detailed Comparison Using Views 6-11

Comparing the **top view (Image 6)** with answer choices:
- The reference has a distinctive H-shape or two-cluster pattern with central gap
- Purple blocks on one side, green blocks distributed throughout

Looking at the **3D angular views (Images 8-13)**:
- The purple tower's relative position to other colored blocks
- The way blocks stack and create the irregular silhouette
- The central gap visible from multiple angles

### Elimination Process:

**Choice 1**: The block arrangement and the position of the purple tower relative to green and teal blocks matches the reference structure when rotated. The two-cluster configuration with central void is preserved.

**Choice 2**: The structure looks similar but examining the spatial relationships more carefully, the purple tower's position relative to surrounding blocks appears consistent with a different rotation angle of the same object.

**Choice 3**: Shows more vertical emphasis with the purple tower very prominent. The mass distribution and block relationships match what would be seen if the reference were rotated to stand more upright.

**Choice 4**: Has the characteristic gap and irregular arrangement, but the specific configuration of how blocks relate to each other spatially appears consistent as well.

## Step 4: Final Verification

Looking most carefully at the structural fingerprint:
- The purple tower's height and position relative to other elements
- The central void's orientation
- The two-cluster mass distribution

**Choice 3** shows the structure in a more upright position with the purple tower prominent and vertical, the gap clearly visible, and the overall mass distribution matching a rotation where we're viewing the object from a front-bottom perspective that has been rotated significantly.

After careful analysis of the shape arrangement and spatial relationships:

============================================================


57: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object using views 6-11.

## Reference Object Key Features (from views 6-11):

**View 8 (Front-Top-Right):** Shows a distinctive arrangement with a 2x3 block structure (purple, green, teal blocks) on the left, and brown/purple blocks extending to the right.

**View 9 (Back-Top-Right):** Shows the back side with brown/orange blocks on left, a central blue/green section, and purple blocks.

**View 10 (Back-Top-Left):** Shows brown blocks on left, orange/gray center blocks, and a blue/green/purple section rising on the right.

**View 11 (Front-Top-Left):** Shows purple/blue blocks upper left, green blocks in center-left, and large brown blocks lower right.

**View 12 (Front-Bottom-Right):** Shows the 2x3 colored block section clearly on left (purple, green, blue arrangement) with brown/purple blocks on right.

**View 13 (Back-Bottom-Left):** Shows brown blocks on left, orange blocks, green block elevated, and blue/purple section.

## Analyzing Each Choice:

**Choice 1:** 
Looking at the orientation, I can see a different arrangement. The spatial relationship between the brown blocks and the colored (purple/green/blue) section appears rotated but the overall shape structure seems to match. The tall stack and L-shaped elements are present.

**Choice 2:**
This shows a flattened, more horizontal arrangement. The vertical stacking doesn't match the reference's prominent vertical elements. The spatial relationships look different - ELIMINATED.

**Choice 3:**
This shows the characteristic vertical stack and the arrangement of blocks matches the reference structure when rotated. The brown blocks, purple blocks, and green blocks maintain their spatial relationships. The isolated elements and overall shape match.

**Choice 4:**
The arrangement appears similar to Choice 1 but from a different angle. Checking the spatial relationships: the tall colored stack, the brown horizontal section, and scattered blocks all appear consistent with the reference.

## Detailed Comparison of Remaining Choices (1, 3, 4):

Comparing **Choice 3** specifically:
- Has the prominent 2x3 colored block section
- Shows the brown block extensions correctly
- The isolated purple block relationship is maintained
- The overall L-shaped structure with vertical elements matches
- When mentally rotating, this configuration aligns with multiple reference views

Comparing **Choice 1**:
- Shows similar elements but the orientation seems slightly off
- The relationship between the tall section and horizontal sections needs verification

Comparing **Choice 4**:
- Very similar to Choice 1, appears to be another valid rotation angle
- Structure maintains correct spatial relationships

After careful analysis of the shape arrangements and spatial relationships, **Choice 3** best matches the reference object as a valid rotation.

## Detailed Comparison:

Focusing on **shape arrangement** over color:

**Choice 1:** The block distribution and stepped pattern closely matches the reference views. The asymmetric nature with blocks extending in multiple directions aligns well.

**Choice 2:** The shape profile matches well. The stepped arrangement and the way blocks project outward is consistent with the reference object from a rotated perspective.

**Choice 3:** Good match in terms of overall shape. The stepped structure and block positioning appears correct for a rotation.

**Choice 4:** The shape appears consistent with proper stepping and asymmetric block arrangement.

## Critical Distinction:

Examining the specific **spatial relationships and step patterns**:

- The reference object has a very specific stepped pattern visible in the isometric views

**2**

============================================================

59: I'll analyze this puzzle systematically, focusing on the 3D structure and spatial arrangements shown in views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left, Front-Bottom-Right, Back-Bottom-Left).

## Step 1: Understanding the Reference Object Structure

From the orthogonal and angled views, I can identify:
- A **main larger block structure** (approximately 2×2×3 units)
- A **small single cube** (detached, positioned front-left-bottom)
- A **smaller rectangular piece** (1×1×3, positioned front-right)

The object has three distinct components with specific spatial relationships.

## Step 2: Analyzing Each Answer Choice

### **Choice 1 (First/Leftmost):**
Looking at the arrangement:
- Shows blocks scattered/separated in a disassembled pattern
- The spatial relationship shows pieces pulled apart from each other
- This appears to be an "exploded" or separated view rather than a simple rotation

### **Choice 2 (Second from left):**
Examining the configuration:
- Shows a more compact arrangement
- The blocks appear to maintain closer proximity
- Looking at the color patterns and block positions from the angled views
- The rectangular 1×1×3 piece and single cube appear in different positions relative to the main structure

### **Choice 3 (Third from left):**
Analyzing the structure:
- The three components maintain their relative positions
- The single small cube (teal/cyan) is visible at the front-left-bottom area
- The main 2×2×3 structure is positioned in the back
- The 1×1×3 piece is at the front-right
- The spatial relationships match what I see in views 6-11

### **Choice 4 (Fourth/Rightmost):**
Examining this option:
- Shows a different orientation with blocks arranged differently
- The relative positions of the three components appear altered
- The viewing angle and block relationships don't match the reference views

## Step 3: Elimination Process

**Eliminating Choice 1:** The blocks are too dispersed - this is an exploded view, not a rotation.

**Eliminating Choice 2:** When comparing with the top view (Image 6) and angled views (Images 8-13), the arrangement of the three components doesn't match. The spatial relationships are incorrect.

**Eliminating Choice 4:** The configuration shows blocks in positions that don't align with the reference object's structure when considering proper 3D rotation.

## Step 4: Verification of Choice 3

Checking Choice 3 against multiple reference views:
- The small teal cube is positioned front-left-bottom ✓
- The main 2×2×3 structure occupies the back-left-upper area ✓
- The 1×1×3 rectangular piece is front-right ✓
- The overall spatial relationships between all three components are preserved ✓
- This represents a valid rotation of the reference object ✓

============================================================

61: I'll analyze each answer choice systematically by comparing them to the reference object views, focusing on shape arrangement and spatial relationships.

## Step 1: Analyze the Reference Object Structure

From the orthogonal views (Top, Bottom, and the four diagonal views), I can identify:
- A complex 3D structure with stepped/staggered arrangement
- Approximately 3-4 layers in height
- Irregular footprint with blocks at various positions
- Key structural features: protruding blocks, internal voids, asymmetric layout

## Step 2: Examine Each Answer Choice

### **Answer Choice 1 (leftmost):**
Looking at the orientation in Image 1, this shows:
- A stepped structure ascending from bottom-left to upper-right
- Purple blocks visible on the lower left
- Green and brown blocks in upper regions
- The overall silhouette appears to match a diagonal rotation of the reference

### **Answer Choice 2:**
Shows:
- Different orientation with blocks arranged vertically
- Color distribution seems different from typical rotations
- The stepping pattern doesn't match the reference structure well
- Spatial relationships appear inconsistent

### **Answer Choice 3:**
Displays:
- Another diagonal view with distinct stepping
- Purple and green blocks in specific positions
- The arrangement looks similar to reference views
- Need to verify spatial relationships carefully

### **Answer Choice 4:**
Shows:
- A diagonal perspective 
- Block arrangement and stepping pattern
- Color positions need verification against reference

## Step 3: Detailed Comparison Using Key Views

Comparing with **Top View (Image 6)** and **Front-Top-Right (Image 8)**:
- The reference shows a purple column on the left side (top view)
- Bright green blocks in specific positions
- Distinctive stepped pattern visible in diagonal views

**Choice 1** matches well:
- The purple blocks are positioned correctly for a rotated view
- The green blocks appear in appropriate spatial relationships
- The stepping pattern aligns with the reference structure
- Overall silhouette and block layering is consistent

**Choice 2** has issues:
- The vertical arrangement doesn't match any natural rotation
- Block positions seem compressed differently

**Choice 3** shows:
- Similar features but checking the exact spatial arrangement
- The purple block positions relative to green blocks
- Seems close but need to verify exact configuration

**Choice 4**:
- Different orientation that needs checking
- Block arrangements need verification

## Step 4: Final Verification

Comparing Choice 1 with **Front-Top-Left (Image 11)** and **Front-Top-Right (Image 8)**:
- Choice 1's perspective matches a rotation that would show the purple blocks on one side
- The green blocks in upper positions align correctly
- The stepped architecture is preserved
- All spatial relationships are maintained

Choice 1 shows the most consistent match with the reference object from a rotated perspective, maintaining all key structural features and spatial relationships.

============================================================

62: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left, Front-Bottom-Right, Back-Bottom-Left) and prioritizing shape arrangement over color.

## Key Shape Features from Reference Views:

**Top View (Image 6):** L-shaped footprint with a gap/hole (white square) in the middle-right area. Approximately 3x4 grid with missing blocks.

**Bottom View (Image 7):** Shows the underside with the same gap pattern, confirming a void through the structure.

**3D Angled Views (Images 8-13):** Show a complex stepped structure with blocks at varying heights, an internal void, and an asymmetric arrangement.

## Analysis of Each Choice:

### **Choice 1 (leftmost):**
Looking at the 3D perspective view, this shows a relatively flat, spread-out arrangement. The structure appears to be mostly at one or two height levels with blocks extending more horizontally. The shape doesn't show the prominent vertical stacking and stepped profile visible in the reference object's angled views. The footprint and arrangement look different from the L-shaped pattern with central void.

**Verdict: Eliminate - Shape arrangement doesn't match**

### **Choice 2:**
This shows a tilted view with significant vertical variation. The structure has multiple height levels and appears more compact. However, examining the block arrangement, the way blocks are stacked and their relative positions seem to create a different silhouette than the reference. The spatial relationships between the elevated blocks don't match the reference's stepped pattern.

**Verdict: Possibly eliminate - arrangement seems off**

### **Choice 3:**
This displays a structure with clear vertical variation and a stepped appearance. Looking at the arrangement, I can see blocks at multiple heights with some protruding elements. The overall footprint and the way blocks relate to each other spatially appears consistent with the reference object. The void/gap would be internal and not visible from this angle. The stepping pattern and asymmetric arrangement match well.

**Verdict: Strong candidate**

### **Choice 4 (rightmost):**
This shows a diagonal/tilted perspective with blocks at various heights. The structure has a spread-out appearance with distinct sections. Comparing to the reference object's angled views, the spatial arrangement and how the blocks connect seems different. The profile doesn't match the reference's characteristic stepped pattern.

**Verdict: Eliminate - spatial arrangement doesn't match**

## Verification of Choice 3:

Comparing Choice 3 to the reference object's angled views (Images 8-13):
- ✓ Shows multiple height levels in a stepped arrangement
- ✓ Has asymmetric, irregular block placement
- ✓ The visible blocks' spatial relationships match the reference

============================================================

63: I'll analyze this rotation puzzle systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left, Front-Bottom-Right, Back-Bottom-Left) and prioritizing shape arrangement over color.

## Analysis of Reference Object Shape:

From the various angled views (images 6-11), I can identify:
- A roughly L-shaped or irregular structure
- Two main elevated sections with a gap/space between them
- Left section: has stacked blocks creating height
- Right section: has stacked blocks creating height
- The structure has an asymmetric, architectural quality with multiple levels
- Overall footprint appears wider than it is deep

## Examining Each Answer Choice:

### **Choice 1 (First option, left):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Shows a sprawling, relatively flat configuration
- Has blocks extending in multiple directions
- The arrangement appears more scattered/spread out
- Multiple protrusions at lower levels
- Shape doesn't match the compact, two-tower structure of reference

### **Choice 2 (Second option, highlighted in cyan):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Shows a more compact, vertical structure
- Has distinct elevated sections
- Two main height peaks visible
- The overall silhouette shows stacked blocks forming towers
- Gap/space between elevated sections is visible
- The arrangement matches the L-shaped or irregular footprint
- Proportions appear consistent with reference object

### **Choice 3 (Third option):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Shows a compact structure with elevation
- Has multiple blocks at different heights
- Overall shape appears more square/rectangular
- The configuration seems different from the reference
- Proportions don't match the reference's two-section layout

### **Choice 4 (Fourth option, right):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Shows a complex structure with multiple levels
- Has a different overall silhouette
- The arrangement appears more clustered differently
- Shape doesn't match the reference's distinct two-section structure

## Verification:

**Choice 2** appears to match best because:
1. It has the characteristic two elevated sections with a gap between them
2. The overall footprint and proportions match the reference
3. The stacked arrangement creating height in specific areas is preserved
4. The asymmetric, architectural quality is maintained
5. When considering rotation, this configuration would produce views consistent with the reference angles shown

The other choices show different spatial arrangements that cannot be achieved through simple rotation of the reference object.

============================================================

64: I'll analyze this systematically using views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left, Front-Bottom-Right, Back-Bottom-Left) and focus on shape arrangement.

## Step 1: Analyze the Reference Object's Shape

From the angled views (6-11), I can identify key structural features:

**From Top View (Image 6):**
- Irregular L-shaped or stepped configuration
- Multiple height levels creating a complex 3D profile
- Approximately 4x4 base with varying heights

**From Bottom View (Image 7):**
- Similar irregular footprint
- Shows the underside structure

**From Angled Views (Images 8-13):**
- The structure has a distinctive stepped profile
- Higher blocks cluster in one region (appears to be back-left area)
- Lower blocks in front-right area
- Creates an ascending diagonal pattern

## Step 2: Examine Each Answer Choice

**CHOICE 1 (Top-left):**
- Shows a more compact, clustered arrangement
- Blocks appear to have a different stepping pattern
- The profile seems more horizontal/flat rather than having the diagonal ascending pattern

**CHOICE 2 (Top-right):**
- Shows an irregular arrangement with significant vertical variation
- Has a diagonal stepped appearance
- The blocks ascend from lower-left to upper-right in the view shown
- Profile matches the reference object's characteristic stepping

**CHOICE 3 (Bottom-left):**
- Shows a more spread-out configuration
- The stepping pattern appears different
- Blocks seem more evenly distributed rather than having the distinctive diagonal rise

**CHOICE 4 (Bottom-right):**
- Shows an angled view with blocks
- The arrangement appears similar to Choice 2 but from a different angle
- Has vertical variation and stepping

## Step 3: Detailed Comparison

Focusing on the key structural feature - the **diagonal ascending pattern** visible in images 8-13:

**Reference Object Pattern:**
- Front-Top-Right (Image 8): Shows lower blocks in front-left, rising to back-right
- Back-Top-Right (Image 9): Confirms high blocks in back area
- Back-Top-Left (Image 10): Shows the high back region clearly
- Front-Top-Left (Image 11): Shows lower front area with rise toward back
- Front-Bottom-Right (Image 12): Lower front-right perspective
- Back-Bottom-Left (Image 13): High back-left region visible

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
- Displays the same diagonal stepping from lower to higher
- The silhouette and profile match the reference's characteristic shape
- Block arrangement follows the same ascending pattern
- The viewing angle is consistent with a rotated version of the reference

**Eliminating Others:**
- Choice 1: Too compact, lacks the diagonal rise
- Choice 3: Too spread out, different stepping pattern
- Choice 4: While similar, the specific arrangement and angle don't match as precisely as Choice 2

## Step 4: Verification

Choice 2 shows:
- Correct diagonal stepping pattern (ascending from one corner to opposite)
- Proper height variations matching the reference
- Consistent block clustering pattern
- Appropriate spatial relationships between high and low regions

============================================================

65: I'll analyze each answer choice systematically by comparing them to the reference object views, focusing on shape arrangement and structure.

## Step 1: Analyze the Reference Object Structure

From the orthogonal views (Top, Bottom, and the four isometric views), I can identify:
- A complex asymmetric structure with multiple height levels
- Distinct groupings of blocks with irregular arrangements
- Three main sections visible in top/bottom views
- A tall tower section (4 blocks high) on one side
- Varied depth and width across different sections

## Step 2: Examine Each Answer Choice

### **Choice 1 (Top-left):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Shows separated block groupings
- Left side has a tall configuration (appears 3-4 blocks)
- Right side has multiple smaller grouped sections
- Overall appears fragmented into distinct pieces
- The spatial arrangement shows blocks that are disconnected

### **Choice 2 (Top-right):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Multiple separated groupings
- Different height levels across sections
- Block arrangements appear more scattered
- Less compact than the reference object
- Spacing between groups seems inconsistent with reference

### **Choice 3 (Bottom-left):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Shows two main groupings of blocks
- Left section appears to have significant height
- Right section has multiple levels
- Clear separation between major sections
- The configuration matches the asymmetric nature

### **Choice 4 (Bottom-right):**
Looking at the isometric view:
- Multiple small groupings
- Different arrangement pattern
- Height distribution differs from reference
- Block positioning seems more dispersed

## Step 3: Compare Structural Features

**Focusing on the key structural elements:**

From the **Top View** (Image 6) and **Bottom View** (Image 7), the reference shows:
- Three distinct groupings in specific spatial relationships
- A large base section on one side
- Asymmetric distribution

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
- The left tall section could correspond to the green tower
- The right sections show multiple levels matching the reference complexity
- Spatial relationships appear preserved under rotation

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
- Shows clear two-section division
- Height variations match the reference pattern
- The overall footprint seems compatible

## Step 4: Elimination Process

- **Choice 2**: The block distribution appears too scattered and doesn't maintain the connected structure of the reference
- **Choice 4**: The arrangement is too fragmented and doesn't match the consolidated sections

Between Choices 1 and 3:
- **Choice 1** maintains the tall tower element and shows proper grouping with appropriate separation
- **Choice 3** also shows good structural similarity but the separation pattern differs slightly

Looking more carefully at the **isometric views** (Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, etc.):
- The reference shows a structure that, when rotated, would maintain specific block adjacencies
- Choice 1's left tall section and right multi-level sections better preserve these relationships
- The spatial gaps and connections in Choice 1 align with a rotated version of the reference

## Final Verification

Choice 1 best matches the reference object when considering:
- The preservation of the tall tower section
- The multi-level arrangement on the opposite side
- The overall asymmetric configuration
- The spatial relationships between block groups

- Choices 1 and 4 both show this irregular footprint clearly
- Choices 2 and 3 appear more regular

Comparing **height variation**:
- Reference shows significant height differences: lower front-left, taller back-right
- Choice 1 shows this pattern clearly
- Choice 4 also shows appropriate height variation
- Choice 2 seems too uniform
- Choice 3 seems too compact

Comparing **specific structural features**:
- The reference has blocks extending asymmetrically
- Looking at the left-side extension and right-side height, Choice 1 matches best
- Choice 4 has similar features but the orientation seems slightly different

## Elimination:

**Eliminate Choice 2:** The footprint is too regular and compact; lacks the distinctive notch pattern.

**Eliminate Choice 3:** The overall shape is too rectangular and uniform; doesn't match the irregular footprint of the reference.

**Between Choices 1 and 4:**
Both show similar irregular footprints and height variations. However, examining the specific orientation:
- Choice 1's viewing angle and block arrangement more precisely matches a rotation of the reference object
- The stepped levels and asymmetric distribution align better with Choice 1

============================================================

70: I'll analyze each answer choice systematically by comparing it to the reference object views, focusing on shape arrangement and using views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left).

## Step 1: Examine the Reference Object's Key Features

From the specified views (6-11), I can identify:
- An irregular cluster with protruding blocks
- A separated smaller block/group visible in some views
- Varying heights creating an asymmetric skyline
- The main cluster has approximately 8-10 visible blocks
- There are distinct protrusions and gaps in the structure

## Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice

### **Choice 1 (Far Left):**
Looking at this option:
- Shows a flatter, more spread-out arrangement
- The blocks appear to form two distinct separated groups
- The spatial distribution looks different from the more compact clustered reference
- The arrangement seems too horizontal and separated

### **Choice 2 (Center-Left):**
Examining this option:
- Shows a more vertical, clustered arrangement
- Has distinct height variations
- Appears to have a compact main group with possible separated elements
- The overall profile matches the irregular, tower-like quality of the reference

### **Choice 3 (Center-Right):**
Looking at this option:
- Shows two distinct vertical tower-like formations

- They show two more distinct separate formations
- The symmetry doesn't match the reference's asymmetry

**Choice 1** can be eliminated because:
- Too spread out and horizontal
- Doesn't match the vertical clustering of the reference

## Step 4: Verification

Choice 2 shows an arrangement that, when mentally rotated, maintains:
- The correct spatial relationships between blocks

============================================================

72: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on shape arrangement and using views 6-11 (Top View through Front-Bottom-Right).

## Key Shape Features from Reference Views:

**Top View (Image 6):** Shows an irregular W-like or M-like footprint with two raised towers and gaps between blocks.

**Back-Top-Right (Image 9):** Shows a tower structure on the right side (cyan blocks stacked), with green blocks on the left forming another elevated area.

**Back-Top-Left (Image 10):** Shows the green tower on the left side elevated, with cyan/teal blocks forming a tower on the right.

**Front-Top-Left (Image 11):** Shows elevated structures with blocks arranged in a complex 3D pattern.

**Front-Bottom-Right (Image 12):** Shows the structure from below-front-right with characteristic stepped arrangement.

**Back-Bottom-Left (Image 13):** Shows the underside with the characteristic asymmetric footprint.

## Analyzing Each Answer Choice:

### **Answer Choice 1 (First option - highlighted in cyan border):**
- Shows a compact, relatively flat arrangement
- Has some vertical elements but appears more compressed
- The stepped pattern seems consistent with possible rotation
- Block arrangement shows similar asymmetry

### **Answer Choice 2 (Second option):**
- Shows a more spread-out arrangement
- Has distinct vertical towers
- The spatial relationship between blocks appears different
- The overall footprint seems larger/more extended

### **Answer Choice 3 (Third option):**
- Shows a compact arrangement with clear tower structures
- Has prominent vertical elements on both sides
- The arrangement appears to maintain the W-like footprint
- Block relationships seem preserved

### **Answer Choice 4 (Fourth option):**
- Shows an elongated arrangement
- Has vertical elements but in a different configuration
- The overall shape appears stretched compared to reference

## Detailed Comparison:

Comparing the **reference object's top view** (showing the W/M-like footprint with two towers) with each choice:

- **Choice 1:** When rotated, could show the stepped tower arrangement visible in the reference
- **Choice 2:** The spread suggests a different block configuration
- **Choice 3:** Maintains the dual-tower structure with central depression
- **Choice 4:** The elongated shape doesn't match the more compact reference

Looking at the **3D perspectives** (Images 8-13), the reference has:
- Two distinct elevated areas (towers)
- A lower central region
- Asymmetric but balanced distribution

**Choice 1** appears to show this same structure from a different angle - the towers are visible, the stepped arrangement matches, and the overall compactness is preserved.

**Choice 3** also shows tower structures, but when comparing the exact spatial relationships and how blocks connect, there are subtle differences in the arrangement pattern.

Checking **Answer 1** against multiple reference views:
- The front-facing perspective matches the rotated reference
- The tower positions align correctly
- The stepped/staircase pattern is consistent
- The overall footprint matches when accounting for rotation

============================================================

73: I'll analyze this systematically using the specified views (images 6-11: Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left) and focus primarily on shape arrangement.

## Step 1: Analyze the Reference Object's Shape

From the various angled views, I can identify key structural features:

**Top View (Image 6):** Shows an irregular shape with a distinct L-shaped or cross-like void in the center. The structure has blocks arranged around this central gap.

**Bottom View (Image 7):** Shows a similar irregular pattern from below with gaps and various block positions.

**Front-Top-Right (Image 8):** Shows a stepped, irregular structure rising from lower left to upper center, with blocks at different heights creating an asymmetric profile.

**Back-Top-Right (Image 9):** Shows the structure from the opposite angle with a different stepped profile, blocks rising at various levels.

**Back-Top-Left (Image 10):** Another angled view showing the irregular stepped structure.

**Front-Top-Left (Image 11):** Shows the structure with its characteristic irregular, stepped arrangement.

Key shape features:
- Irregular stepped profile (not a simple rectangular block)
- Central void/gap creating an L-shape or irregular pattern
- Approximately 4-5 blocks wide, 3-4 blocks deep, varying heights
- Asymmetric arrangement with blocks at different levels

## Step 2: Examine Each Answer Choice

**Choice 1 (First option - left side with cyan border):**
Looking at the angled view, this shows a structure with:
- Similar irregular stepped arrangement
- Blocks at varying heights
- Comparable asymmetric profile
- The shape appears to match the reference's irregular pattern

**Choice 2 (Second option):**
This appears more flattened or spread out with:
- Different stepping pattern
- The profile seems less vertical/more horizontal spread
- Shape arrangement doesn't match as closely

**Choice 3 (Third option):**
Shows:
- Different stepped profile
- The arrangement of blocks appears rotated differently
- The overall shape pattern seems altered

**Choice 4 (Fourth option):**
Displays:
- Very different orientation
- The stepping and block arrangement is notably different
- The profile doesn't match the reference's characteristic shape

## Step 3: Elimination Process

**Eliminate Choice 2:** The shape profile is too flat/spread compared to the reference's more compact, vertically-varied structure.

**Eliminate Choice 3:** The stepping pattern and overall arrangement don't match the reference when considering possible rotations.

**Eliminate Choice 4:** The orientation and shape arrangement are clearly different from what would result from rotating the reference object.

**Choice 1 remains:** The irregular stepped profile, the asymmetric arrangement, and the general shape characteristics all match what would be expected from a rotation of the reference object.

## Step 4: Verification

Choice 1 shows the same type of irregular, stepped structure with blocks at varying heights, maintaining the spatial relationships between blocks that would be preserved through rotation. The overall footprint and vertical arrangement align with the reference object when viewed from a rotated perspective.

============================================================

75: I'll analyze each answer choice systematically by comparing it to the reference object views, focusing on shape arrangement and spatial relationships.

## Step 1: Analyze the Reference Object Structure

From the various views (particularly top, bottom, and diagonal views):

- There's a distinctive tall tower section (approximately 3 blocks high)
- The structure has gaps and asymmetric arrangement
- One or two blocks appear separated from the main cluster
- The overall footprint is roughly L-shaped or irregular

## Step 2: Examine Each Answer Choice

**Answer Choice 1 (leftmost):**
- Shows a flattened, more planar arrangement
- Blocks appear mostly at the same height level
- Has a separated block (maroon/brown) in the upper right
- The main cluster is relatively flat with minimal vertical variation
- This appears to be looking at the structure from a tilted angle showing mostly one layer

**Answer Choice 2:**
- Shows significant vertical variation
- Has blocks stacked at different heights creating a 3D stepped appearance
- Multiple blocks visible at various elevations
- The arrangement shows depth with blocks receding into the background
- Has a compact, clustered arrangement

**Answer Choice 3:**
- Shows a more spread out arrangement

- The main structure appears tilted showing multiple faces
- Shows depth and height variation

**Answer Choice 4:**
- Shows vertical stacking with significant height differences
- Has a tall section (appears to be 2-3 blocks high)
- Compact arrangement with blocks at various heights
- Shows good depth with blocks receding
- One separated block visible

## Step 3: Compare with Reference Views

Looking at the **Top View** (Image 6) and diagonal views:
- The reference shows an irregular pattern with separated block(s)
- There's a distinct tall tower section
- The structure has significant 3D complexity

Looking at the **Front-Top-Left** (Image 11) and similar diagonal views:
- Shows the structure from an elevated angle

- Shows one separated block away from main cluster
- The main cluster has varying heights

**Comparing Answer Choice 1:**
- Too flat, lacks the vertical complexity seen in reference
- The arrangement looks more 2D

**Comparing Answer Choice 2:**
- Shows good vertical variation
- All blocks appear connected in main cluster
- Doesn't clearly show the separated block(s)

**Comparing Answer Choice 3:**
- Shows vertical variation and depth
- Has a separated block matching the reference
- The viewing angle appears similar to Front-Top-Left view
- The stepped arrangement matches the reference structure

**Comparing Answer Choice 4:**
- Shows vertical stacking
- Has separated block
- The arrangement is more compact and vertical

## Step 4: Final Verification

Answer Choice 3 best matches the reference object because:
- It shows the characteristic separated block(s)
- The stepped/layered arrangement matches the reference
- The viewing angle is consistent with a rotation of the reference object
- The spatial relationships between blocks are preserved
- The overall shape and footprint match the irregular L-shaped structure

**Top View (Image 6):** Shows an irregular pattern with blocks at various positions - approximately 3x4 grid with gaps
**Front-Top-Right (Image 8):** Shows blocks arranged in a stepped pattern rising from left to right
**Back-Top-Right (Image 9):** Shows the back side with similar stepped arrangement
**Back-Top-Left (Image 10):** Shows another angle of the stepped structure
**Front-Top-Left (Image 11):** Shows front-left perspective with clear step pattern
**Front-Bottom-Right (Image 12):** Shows underside perspective with visible block arrangements

## Key Structural Features:
- Irregular, asymmetric 3D arrangement
- Stepped/staggered height pattern
- Approximately 12-14 blocks total
- Gaps creating an irregular footprint
- No perfect symmetry in any axis

## Analysis of Each Choice:

### **Choice 1 (First option, highlighted in cyan):**
Looking at the arrangement:
- Shows similar stepped pattern
- Block count appears consistent
- Height variation matches reference
- Gaps and irregular footprint present
- Orientation appears to be a rotation of the reference

### **Choice 2 (Second option):**
Examining the structure:
- Stepped arrangement visible
- Block positions seem similar
- Height progression matches
- Irregular pattern present

### **Choice 3 (Third option):**
Analyzing the layout:
- Shows stepped configuration
- Block arrangement appears consistent
- Similar asymmetric pattern
- Gaps in similar positions

### **Choice 4 (Fourth option):**
Checking the structure:
- Stepped pattern present
- Block count seems right
- Height variations match

## Detailed Comparison:

Comparing the **Front-Top-Right view (Image 8)** with each choice:
- The reference shows a distinctive diagonal stepped pattern rising from front-left to back-right
- The highest blocks are positioned toward the back-right area
- There's a characteristic gap pattern in the middle section

**Choice 1:** When I trace the block positions, this matches the stepped diagonal pattern. The highest point aligns correctly, and the gap structure matches the reference.

**Choice 2:** The arrangement appears similar but the diagonal orientation seems off - the highest blocks don't align with where they should be for this rotation.

**Choice 3:** This shows a different orientation of stepping - the progression doesn't match the reference's diagonal pattern correctly.

**Choice 4:** The block arrangement here doesn't match the characteristic stepped pattern when compared to the reference views.

Verifying Choice 1 against **Top View (Image 6)**:
- The irregular footprint pattern matches
- Block positions in the grid correspond correctly
- Gaps are in the right locations for a rotated version

## Step 1: Understanding the Reference Object's Shape

From the orthogonal and angled views, the reference object has:
- An irregular, stepped structure
- Approximately 4x3 base with varying heights (1-3 blocks tall)
- Distinctive asymmetric profile with blocks at different levels
- A terraced appearance descending in one direction

## Step 2: Analyzing Each Answer Choice

### **Answer Choice 1 (leftmost):**
Looking at the perspective:
- Shows a compact, relatively horizontal arrangement
- The stepped profile appears to descend from back-left to front-right
- Block arrangement shows multiple levels with irregular spacing
- Overall footprint and height distribution seem consistent with possible rotation

### **Answer Choice 2 (second from left, highlighted in cyan):**
Looking at the perspective:
- Shows an elongated, diagonal arrangement
- Blocks appear stretched out in a more linear fashion
- The configuration looks distinctly different from the reference's compact, chunky structure
- The proportions seem wrong - too elongated compared to reference

### **Answer Choice 3 (second from right):**
Looking at the perspective:
- Shows a more compact arrangement
- Has a stepped profile visible from this angle
- Block positioning shows irregular heights
- The overall shape appears more spread horizontally than the reference

- Multiple levels visible with irregular stepping
- The compact, chunky nature matches the reference structure
- Proportions and spatial relationships appear consistent

## Step 3: Detailed Comparison with Reference Views

Comparing to **Top View (Image 6)**:
- The reference shows an irregular footprint, roughly 4 blocks wide by 3 deep
- Choice 1: Could match with appropriate rotation
- Choice 2: Too elongated/stretched out
- Choice 3: Proportions seem off
- Choice 4: Compact footprint matches well

Comparing to **Angled Views (Images 8-13)**:
- The reference shows a terraced structure with blocks at 3 distinct height levels
- The stepping pattern is irregular and asymmetric
- Choice 1: Shows similar height variation and stepping
- Choice 2: Linear arrangement doesn't match the chunky reference
- Choice 3: Shape seems too flat/spread
- Choice 4: Height variation and compact nature match well

## Step 4: Elimination Process

**Eliminate Choice 2**: The elongated, stretched-out appearance is inconsistent with the reference object's compact, chunky structure. The proportions are wrong.

**Eliminate Choice 3**: While closer than Choice 2, the horizontal spread and overall proportions don't match the reference's more compact footprint.

**Between Choices 1 and 4**: Both show appropriate compactness and height variation. However, examining the specific arrangement of blocks at different levels and the overall silhouette more carefully:

Choice 4 better matches the reference object's:
- Compact 4x3-ish footprint
- Three-level height variation
- Irregular stepping pattern
- Asymmetric profile

============================================================

86: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left) and prioritizing shape arrangement.

## Reference Object Shape Analysis (from key views):

**Top View (Image 6):** Shows an irregular L-shaped or stepped pattern with blocks at various heights creating a complex skyline.

**Bottom View (Image 7):** Shows the footprint - approximately 5 blocks wide with an irregular arrangement.

**Front-Top-Right (Image 8):** Shows tall columns on the left side, with a stepped-down arrangement toward the right.

**Back-Top-Right (Image 9):** Shows a different profile with columns arranged differently.

**Back-Top-Left (Image 10):** Shows another angle with tall columns visible.

**Front-Top-Left (Image 11):** Shows the arrangement from this perspective with multiple height levels.

## Analyzing Each Answer Choice:

### **Choice 1 (Top-left):**
Looking at the isometric view, I can see:
- Multiple height levels with tall columns
- Irregular stepped arrangement
- The overall footprint and height distribution appears consistent
- Block arrangement shows similar complexity
- The profile shows columns rising at similar positions

### **Choice 2 (Top-right):**
Looking at the isometric view:

================================================================================

87: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on shape arrangement and using views 6-11.

## Reference Object Key Features (from views 6-11):

**Top View (Image 6):** Shows an irregular shape with blocks arranged in a complex pattern - blue blocks on ends, central mass with various colored blocks, stepped arrangement.

**Back-Top-Right (Image 9):** Shows a diagonal view with a distinct layered structure, prominent cyan/teal block on top-right, dark blocks in center, varied colors throughout.

**Back-Top-Left (Image 10):** Shows another diagonal view with green blocks prominent on left side, purple/blue blocks on right, central red/dark blocks, stepped arrangement.

**Front-Top-Left (Image 11):** Shows diagonal view with purple/blue blocks on top-left, dark green blocks prominent, blue block on bottom-right, complex interlocking structure.

**Front-Bottom-Right (Image 12):** Shows cyan block on left, brown/tan blocks, blue blocks, green blocks in middle, stepped diagonal profile.

**Back-Bottom-Left (Image 13):** Shows blue blocks on left, green blocks on top, purple blocks, teal blocks on right, red/dark blocks in center.

## Analyzing Each Choice:

### Choice 1 (leftmost):
Looking at this tilted view, I can see:
- Pink/salmon colored blocks prominent on top
- Blue and cyan blocks
- Dark green blocks
- The overall shape profile appears similar to the reference
- The stepped, irregular arrangement matches
- Color positions when accounting for rotation seem consistent

### Choice 2:
- Shows a more flattened arrangement
- Green blocks prominent
- Blue blocks visible
- The spatial arrangement looks different - appears more compressed
- The profile doesn't match the reference's irregular stepped pattern as well

### Choice 3:
- Shows prominent purple blocks on top
- Pink/salmon blocks
- Green blocks below
- Dark blocks in center
- The arrangement appears similar to the reference
- However, the exact positioning seems slightly off compared to choice 1

### Choice 4:
- Very similar appearance to choice 3
- Purple blocks on top
- Pink blocks
- Green and dark blocks
- The profile and arrangement look nearly identical to choice 3

## Detailed Comparison:

Comparing choices 3 and 4 more carefully - they appear nearly identical in the question image, which suggests they might be the same orientation.

Comparing choice 1 to the reference views:
- The diagonal orientation in choice 1 matches well with Image 10 (Back-Top-Left)
- The pink/salmon blocks visible in choice 1 correspond to the red/brown blocks in the reference
- The blue blocks at the extremities match
- The stepped profile and irregular shape match perfectly

Choice 2 appears too flat and compressed compared to the reference's more complex 3D structure.

Choices 3 and 4 both show similar orientations but when compared to reference views like Image 11 (Front-Top-Left) and Image 12 (Front-Bottom-Right), the block arrangements don't align as precisely as choice 1.

88: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on views 6-11 (Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left) and prioritizing shape arrangement over color.

## Key Shape Features from Reference Views:

**Top View (Image 6):** 
- Cross-like or branching pattern
- Hollow center space
- Isolated block on lower left
- Approximately 4-5 units wide, 3-4 units deep

**Bottom View (Image 7):**
- Similar branching pattern
- Multiple blocks around edges

============================================================

89: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice with the reference object using the specified views (6th through 11th: Top, Bottom, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left).

## Step 1: Analyze the Reference Object's Key Shape Features

From the orthographic and 3D views:
- **Top View (Image 6)**: Shows an irregular footprint with blocks arranged in a complex pattern, extending more left-to-right with some depth
- **Bottom View (Image 7)**: Similar irregular footprint from below
- **Various 3D angles**: Show a compact, asymmetric structure with stepped heights

Key shape characteristics:
- Irregular, non-rectangular footprint
- Stepped/layered construction
- Approximately 3-4 blocks wide, 3-4 deep, 2-3 tall
- Asymmetric design with protruding sections

## Step 2: Examine Each Answer Choice

### **Choice 1 (Top-left):**
- Shows a relatively flat arrangement
- Blocks appear spread out in a more planar configuration
- Less vertical stacking visible
- Shape appears more scattered/dispersed

### **Choice 2 (Top-right):**
- Compact, stacked structure
- Shows clear stepped/layered arrangement
- Has depth and height similar to reference
- Irregular footprint matches reference complexity

### **Choice 3 (Bottom-left):**
- Compact structure with visible stacking
- Shows stepped arrangement
- Orientation appears different but structure is similar
- Has the irregular, asymmetric quality

### **Choice 4 (Bottom-right):**
- Compact structure
- Shows clear layering and steps
- Similar height and depth proportions
- Irregular footprint present

## Step 3: Detailed Comparison

**Eliminating Choice 1:**
- The flat, dispersed arrangement doesn't match the reference's compact, stepped structure
- The spatial relationships appear too spread out
- Doesn't show the same vertical stacking pattern

**Comparing Choices 2, 3, and 4:**

Looking at the **stepped arrangement pattern**:
- Reference shows blocks creating an irregular stepped pattern
- The structure has specific protrusions and recesses

**Choice 2**: 
- Shows a compact structure with clear steps
- The arrangement of blocks creates similar irregular edges
- Depth and layering match the reference

**Choice 3**:
- Also shows compact structure with steps
- Orientation suggests a different rotation
- Block arrangement pattern is consistent with reference

**Choice 4**:
- Compact with clear layering
- Shows similar stepped configuration
- Block spatial relationships match

## Step 4: Final Verification

Focusing on **shape arrangement** over color:

The reference object has a specific configuration where blocks create an irregular, stepped structure with:
- A wider base
- Elevated sections creating steps
- Asymmetric protrusions

**Choice 2** most accurately represents a rotation of this configuration:
- The stepped pattern is preserved
- The irregular footprint matches
- The spatial relationships between blocks are consistent
- The overall proportions (width, depth, height) align with the reference

90: I'll analyze this systematically by comparing each answer choice to the reference object, focusing on images 6-11 (Top View, Bottom View, Front-Top-Right, Back-Top-Right, Back-Top-Left, Front-Top-Left).

## Key Features from Reference Images 6-11:

**Top View (Image 6):**
- Hollow center with blocks arranged around it
- Isolated dark blue cube in upper right
- Olive/yellow-green block visible
- L-shaped or irregular perimeter

**Bottom View (Image 7):**
- Similar hollow structure
- Isolated dark blue cube in lower right
- Maroon blocks visible
- Browns and greens in lower portion

**3D Angled Views (Images 8-11):**
- Show the stepped, multi-level structure
- Isolated dark blue cube maintains position relative to main body
- Asymmetric configuration with varying heights

## Analysis of Answer Choices:

**Choice 1:**
- Shows a different viewing angle
- The structure appears more compact
- Need to check if isolated cube and hollow center match

**Choice 2:**
- Has a distinctive tilted appearance
- Shows separation between main structure and isolated piece
- The hollow center appears visible
- Color arrangement needs verification

**Choice 3:**
- Shows a more unified, compact structure
- Appears to have similar stepped levels
- Isolated cube relationship needs checking

**Choice 4:**
- Nearly identical appearance to Choice 3
- Same compact structure
- Similar viewing angle

## Detailed Comparison:

Looking at the **shape arrangement** (as prioritized):

**Choice 1:** The overall shape shows a stepped structure with what appears to be the correct hollow center and separated cube configuration. The general form matches the asymmetric, multi-level structure.

**Choice 2:** This shows a distinctly tilted/rotated view. The separation of the dark blue cube is not visible and prominent. The hollow center structure is apparent. The stepped levels and irregular shape match the reference object's configuration.

**Choice 3 & 4:** These appear nearly identical and show a more consolidated view. However, examining carefully, the spatial relationships and the way the hollow center would appear from this angle seem consistent.

Comparing the stepped arrangement and hollow center visibility:
- Choice 1 shows clear separation and the distinctive hollow structure
- The angled perspective in Choice 1 aligns with how the reference object would appear when rotated to show both the hollow center and the isolated cube
- The multi-level stepping is clearly visible

**Choice 1** best matches the reference object's characteristic features: the hollow center, the isolated cube's position, and the overall asymmetric stepped structure.
