1: I need to analyze the original object and compare it with the four answer choices by examining the rotated views provided.

From the original image and the rotated views (Images 2-9), I can identify key features:
- A complex 3D shape made of colored cubes
- Notable features include: a dark purple cube at the top, green cubes, blue cubes, red cubes, tan/beige cubes, and a small gray cube
- The shape has an irregular, asymmetric structure

Let me examine each answer choice in Image 1:

**Choice 1 (leftmost):** Shows the shape tilted, with visible purple, green, blue, tan, and black cubes. The arrangement shows a gap/hole in the middle.

**Choice 2 (second from left):** Shows a different angle with green, blue, purple, and other colored cubes. The structure appears more compact.

**Choice 3 (third from left):** Shows the shape from another angle with blue, green, purple cubes visible, with a white gap in the middle.

**Choice 4 (rightmost):** Shows the shape tilted differently, with purple, blue, green, and tan cubes visible.

Comparing with the detailed rotated views (Images 2-9), I can see:
- The gray cube is a distinctive feature
- The dark purple cube at the top
- The arrangement of green cubes
- The red cube placement
- The overall asymmetric structure

Looking at Image 6, which shows a top-down view, and Image 8, which shows another clear angle, I can match the color patterns and structure.

**Answer: 2**

The second option correctly shows the rotated shape with the proper arrangement of colored blocks, including the distinctive gray cube, purple cube positioning, and the overall structural configuration matching the rotated views.
2: I need to analyze the reference object shown at the top of Image 1 and compare it with the four answer choices.

Let me examine the reference object's structure:
- It has a complex 3D arrangement of colored cubes
- Key colors I can identify: pink/magenta, purple, green (multiple shades), blue, red, cyan, yellow-green, brown, tan/beige
- The shape has an irregular, asymmetric form

Now let me analyze each answer choice by looking at all the rotated views (Images 2-9):

**Answer Choice 1 (leftmost):**
- Shows a more spread out, flatter arrangement
- Has a separate brown cube
- The main structure appears more horizontal

**Answer Choice 2:**
- Has the brown cube separate
- The main structure shows similar color patterns to the reference
- Looking at the rotated views, I can see purple, magenta, various greens, blues, red, cyan

**Answer Choice 3:**
- Also has a separate brown/gray cube
- The structure appears more vertical/tower-like in some views
- Color arrangement seems different

**Answer Choice 4 (rightmost):**
- Shows a diagonal/slanted arrangement
- Has the brown cube separate
- Structure appears more linear

Comparing the spatial arrangement and colors across all rotated views (Images 2-9), Answer Choice 2 matches the reference object best. The positioning of the purple cube, the arrangement of the green cubes, the placement of the red and blue cubes, and the overall 3D structure align with the reference when rotated.

3: I need to analyze the original object shown in Image 1 and determine which of the four answer choices matches it when rotated.

Let me examine the original object in Image 1:
- It has a cluster of colored blocks including purple, pink, brown, green, yellow, light blue, and dark blue blocks
- There's a separate small green cube to the right
- The main cluster has a distinctive arrangement

Now let me look at the rotated views (Images 2-9) to understand the 3D structure better:
- The object has multiple layers
- Key colors to track: large blue blocks, purple blocks, pink/brown blocks, green blocks, yellow block, light blue block
- The separate green cube is important for orientation

Analyzing each answer choice:

**Choice 1**: Looking at the arrangement, I can see the green cube positioned separately, and the main cluster has a similar color distribution.

**Choice 2**: The green cube and main cluster arrangement looks different from the original orientation.

**Choice 3**: This shows a different perspective with the blocks arranged differently.

**Choice 4**: The arrangement and orientation appear to match the rotated views I've seen.

Comparing with the rotated views (especially Images 6 and 7 which show perspectives similar to the answer choices), and tracking the position of key blocks:
- The large blue blocks
- The purple blocks on top
- The pink/brown blocks extending out
- The separate green cube position

The arrangement in **Choice 4** best matches the original object when considering the spatial relationships between all colored blocks and the separate green cube.

4: I need to analyze the original puzzle image and compare it with the four answer options by using the rotated views (Images 2-9) to understand the 3D structure.

From the original image, I can see a 3D structure made of colored cubes with some cubes separated from the main cluster.

Let me examine the key features:
- There's a main cluster of cubes in various colors (purple, green, blue, red, pink, etc.)
- There are two small green cubes separated from the main structure on the left side
- The main cluster has a specific arrangement with distinct color patterns

Now, looking at the four answer options and comparing them with the rotated views:

Option 1: Shows cubes more spread out with a different arrangement
Option 2: Shows a compact cluster with separated green cubes
Option 3: Shows a different configuration with cubes arranged differently
Option 4: Shows the main cluster on the left with separated cubes on the right

By examining the rotated views (Images 2-9), I can see:
- The structure has a specific core arrangement
- There are indeed separated green cubes
- The color pattern and spatial relationships need to match

Comparing the arrangements and the positions of the separated cubes relative to the main cluster, Option 4 shows the correct rotation where:
- The main cluster is positioned correctly
- The separated green cubes are in the right relative position
- The color arrangements match when rotated

**Answer: 4**

The reasoning is that Option 4 correctly shows the rotated structure with the main cluster and the separated green cubes in their proper relative positions, matching the 3D model shown in the various rotated views.
5: I need to analyze the target object in Image 1 and find which of the four options matches it when rotated.

Let me examine the target object's key features:
- It's a cluster of colored cubes
- I can see specific color positions and arrangements
- The overall shape has a specific 3D structure

Now I'll use the additional rotated views (Images 2-9) to understand the complete 3D structure from all angles.

Looking at the four answer options and comparing them with the various rotated views:

**Option 1**: Has a specific arrangement with cubes extending in a particular pattern
**Option 2**: Shows a different configuration 
**Option 3**: Has cubes arranged in another distinct pattern
**Option 4**: Shows yet another arrangement

By carefully comparing the color positions and block orientations across all the rotated views:

- The target has a distinctive arrangement with specific colored blocks in particular positions
- Looking at the magenta/purple blocks, green blocks, blue blocks, and their relative positions
- The overall shape and how blocks extend in different directions

After analyzing all views and matching the color patterns and spatial relationships, the answer is:

**3**
