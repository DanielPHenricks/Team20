Create a precise 3D model of a this cube arrangement composed of unit cubes arranged in the exact configuration shown. The structure contains cubes in the following colors: deep purple/magenta, light purple/lavender, bright lime green, dark forest green, navy blue, red-orange, gray, and dark navy/black.

Take care in maintaining the exact spatial relationships and color positions of each cube. By moving around the scene, each view should clearly show which cubes are visible from that perspective, with proper occlusion of hidden cubes.

Ensure that:
    All cube positions remain spatially consistent across all views
    Each cube maintains its original color
    The overall structure's dimensions and proportions are preserved
    Gaps and overhangs in the structure are accurately represented
    Each orthographic view is properly aligned and scaled
    Important: these cubes are the only thing in the scene.
